Swiping through my timelines it happens from time to time that I stumble upon a podcast episode that sounds especially interesting. The issue is, I don't necessarily wanna subscribe to the full thing but only 'd like to listen to that specific episode. 

While this issue is a solved problem in general (thanks to the awesome service called [Huffduffer][huffduffer]) it lately became an issue again on my mobile phone (where I tend to consume my timelines) since my beloved [huffduffer-workflow][jancbeck] stopped working and the all-new [shortcuts][shortcuts]-app ... well, is not my friend.

But some days ago I stumbled upon the [scriptable][scriptable]-app and I saw my chance to bring back my `huffduffit`-share-sheet action. Although I wasn't patient enough to find a good getting-starting tutorial I was able to craft an solution that did the job for now pretty quickly.

You can find the [script in here][huffduffit] - import it to [scriptable][scriptable] and you're good to go:
